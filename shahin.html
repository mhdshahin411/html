    <p>The true intent of a paragraph is to express coherent points <br> 
        It could be one sentence or through many sentences <br> 
        The idea or what we call the “main idea” of the paragraph always <br>
         flows in one direction. As soon as this idea changes, we change the paragraph too <br> </p>
